# Kernel Conditional Moment Constraints for Confounding Robust Inference

This repository contains source code to replicate the results of the above paper.
The code is in `Python 3` and depends on recent version (as of October 2022) of `numpy`, `scipy`, `scikit-learn`, `torch`, and `cvxpy`. 
The core part of the code is provided as a python package `kcmc` and other codes for experiments can be found on the jupyter notebook files.

To install the package `kcmc` with `pip`, move to the directory of this file and use
```bash
pip intall kcmc
```
or 
```bash
pip install -e kcmc
```
if you want to edit the installed package.
